# Public-Transport-All-Pairs-Least-Cost-Path-Dijkstra
This is a modified Dijkstra algorithm that solves the All Pairs Least Cost Paths (APLCP) problem, factoring in costs (waiting time and fare) incurred conditionally at transfer nodes. 
A public transportation graph (Class TransitGraph) is defined which inherits from NetworkXâ€™s Graph and holds additional methods and attributes that are necessary for calculating transfers and conditional costs.

This was first developed to prepare the inputs of a network design problem.
